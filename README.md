# 📊 Monthly Expense Tracker - Python (Beginner Project)

Hi! This is a small project I made while learning Python to track daily expenses for a full month.

The idea is simple: I enter my budget at the beginning, and then whenever I spend something, I add the amount and category. The program keeps showing how much I've spent so far and whether I’m still within my budget or not.

---

## 🔧 How it Works

- At the start, you enter your monthly budget (like ₹5000)
- Then it asks you for each expense:
  - How much did you spend?
  - What was it for (like food, travel, etc.)
- It keeps adding your expenses to a list
- After every entry, it shows total spent
- If you cross the budget, it warns you

At the end, it prints a neat summary of all expenses with total spent and remaining budget.

## 🧠 What I Practiced in This Project

- How to use lists to store multiple values
- Looping using `while True` and `for i in range(...)`
- Using `sum()` function to calculate total
- Taking and cleaning user input using `.strip()` and `.lower()`
- Showing formatted output using `f-strings`
- Basic condition checks (if-else)

## 💻 Running the Code

You can run the file in any Python 3 environment (VS Code, PyCharm, or terminal):

python expense_tracker.py

Then just follow the prompts.

## 🔎 Why I Made This

I wanted to build something practical while learning Python basics.  
Instead of just printing "hello world" or numbers, I decided to make something useful where I could track my budget (because even students need to manage expenses 😄).

It helped me understand how lists, loops, and conditions actually work in real-world logic.
